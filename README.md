# Automated-Biryani-Serving-in-C-using-multithreading
Automated Biryani Serving simulator in C programming language using multithreading.       
Each chef, table and diner is programmed as a thread running on a common code.        
To run the code use the following commands -        
> gcc Q2.c    
> ./a.out       
> number_of_chefs number_of_tables number_of_diners  

A simulation will now run.
